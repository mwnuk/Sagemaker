1. Always use entire time series for training, testing and inference
2. Use entire dataset as test set, remove lat time points for training, evaluate on withheld values
3. don't use very large values for prediction length >400
4. train on many timeseries and not just one when possible

hyperparameters
- Freq
- Context length- number of steps it sees before making prediction
- Epochs

- learning rate
- num_cells  - neurons
- num_layers
- likelihood 
- dropout_rate
- early_stopping
   can use CPU or GPU
